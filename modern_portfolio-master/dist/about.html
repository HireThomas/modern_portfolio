        <p>After completing a Front-End Developer Challenge Course with #GrowWithGoogle I was selected and sponsored by Google as one of 1,500 recipients out of 50,000 applicants for a Front-End Developer Nanodegree in conjunction with Udacity.  I'm consistently utilizing and working with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Vue, Python, NodeJS Mongodb, MySQL, PostgreSQL.</p>

          <p>Changing careers has been the best experience of my life as I'm doing what I love. With that said, I'm an individual who never stops growing, is a team player, and who isn't afraid to lead.</p>
          
          <p>I’m most passionate about learning and helping others navigate their way into this industry in addition to creating solutions to teach the next generations to come how to code and innovate. If you need help - do not hesitate to reach out :)!</p>
          
          <p>At the moment I’m a serial entrepreneur and I love it. I’m heavily into the SaaS industry and believe that of all the technologies that will impact our future the most, blockchains, smart contracts and automation will far exceed all else. If you think and/or feel similarly, feel free to reach out to me.</p>
          
          <h4>Optional Previous Experience:</h4>
          
          <p>As a former Project Manager I have delivered multimillion dollar projects that met the expected quality, cost and time restraints while making sure that occupational safety and health requirements were met. I was responsible for setting up, managing, delivering and closing-off a portfolio of twenty-two individual projects.</p> 
          <p>The typical scope of a project comprises the design, construction, install test and commissioning of up to 10 miles of interconnected railway track in switchyards for rolling stock. I was involved in all stages of the business, from the contract negotiations to delivering the project.</p>
